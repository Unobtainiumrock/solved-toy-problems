# About
  This is a compilation of toy problems I've solved. I've done countless problems before, but I thought it'd be a good idea to start showing how I go about solving these things. I'll also be adding my solutions to problems from my Leet Code account. As an added bonus, I'll provide tests to accompany each problem.


**note: still uploading solutions from various sources. There's only a sorting algorithm currently uploaded.**
